### Program1

Simply generates a sales report based on an input file
The input file must be passed in in the terminal
The input file must have 12 lines of numbers in order to function correctly, nothing else
The program assumes these numbers are formatted corectly from Jan-Dec
Ex: "./SalesReport data.txt"

### Program2

Generates all the possible scoring plays given a score
The program will continue to prompt until a value of 0 or 1 is passed in
Very large values over 300 and negative values will not be accepted
